  "Body": "The just war theory (Latin: bellum iustum)[1][2] is a doctrine, also referred to as a tradition, of military ethics that aims to ensure that a war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria, all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. It has been studied by military leaders, theologians, ethicists and policymakers. The theory is divided into two categories: the justice of war (jus ad bellum) and the justice in war (jus in bello). The former deals with the morality of going to war, while the latter focuses on the right conduct within war. The principles of the just war theory can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans, and Indian subcontinent, and have been discussed and refined by various philosophers and religious scholars throughout history. The criteria for determining a just war include just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, probability of success, last resort, proportionality, and non-combatant immunity. These criteria serve as a framework for evaluating the moral legitimacy of engaging in war. Proponents of the just war theory argue that it provides a moral restraint on the use of military force and helps prevent unnecessary suffering and destruction. Critics, however, raise concerns about the subjective interpretation of the criteria and the potential for abuse in applying them to specific conflicts. Despite the ongoing debates and challenges, the just war theory remains a significant ethical framework in discussions of international relations, military intervention, and the conduct of armed conflict. It continues to influence the development of international law and the ethical decision-making of political and military leaders around the world."
